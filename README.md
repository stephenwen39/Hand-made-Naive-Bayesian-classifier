# Hand-made-Naive-Bayesian_classifier

I currently use Python with pandas and numpy lib to consist a basic naive bayesian classifier .

With:
1. Selective Naive Bayesian method to selecte the best attributes which can result the best accuracy

2. 5 fold cross validation in __init__, you can change it with other numbers like 10 or 2.

Warning:

1.Can't process the missing value
