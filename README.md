# Hand-made_Naive_Bayesian_classifier

I currently use Python with pandas and numpy lib to consist a basic naive bayesian classifier .

With:
1. Selective Naive Bayesian method to selecte the best attributes which can result the best accuracy.

2. 5 fold cross validation in __init__, you can change it with other numbers like 10 or 2.

3. Laplace's estimate is using with every possibally attributes value.

4. Dirichlet prior is using and testing after finish the SNB. 

Warning:

1.Can't process the missing value.

2.Can only process "non-string attribute", including all of the attributes.
